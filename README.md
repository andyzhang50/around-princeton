# AroundPrinceton

AroundPrinceton is an “Around-Me”-like app which students and campus visitors may use to locate various campus facilities. When a user wishes to find a certain facility, such as a laundry room or bathroom, the user may choose a type of facility from a list. Then, the app will plot facilities of that type on a map. The user may select any facility on the map to see a more detailed description of the facility and to view specific information on its exact location. The user may also look up buildings to view their location and to get information on the facilities that may be found inside.
